An AI-powered web application that predicts traffic accident risk based on environmental conditions and driver behavior, providing safety recommendations in real-time.
# Traffic Risk Predictor

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the risk of traffic accidents based on environmental conditions and driver behavior. This tool helps drivers make informed decisions about travel safety by evaluating multiple risk factors and providing actionable recommendations.

## About the Project

This application uses a Random Forest classifier trained on traffic accident data to estimate the probability of a serious accident given specific conditions. Users can input various parameters such as:

- Weather conditions (clear, rain, snow, fog)
- Road type (urban, highway, rural)
- Road conditions (dry, wet, icy)
- Driver factors (alcohol involvement, fatigue)
- Speed limit
- Time of day

The model analyzes these inputs and provides:
1. A risk assessment level (Low, Moderate, High)
2. A probability score indicating the likelihood of a serious accident
3. Recommended actions based on the risk level

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Gradio (for the web interface)
- scikit-learn (Random Forest model)
- Pandas & NumPy (data processing)

## Purpose

This project aims to promote road safety by helping drivers understand risk factors and make better decisions about when and how to travel. It can be particularly useful for:

- Planning safer routes and travel times
- Educational purposes for new drivers
- Research on traffic safety factors
- Supporting evidence-based road safety policies

Created as part of a data science learning journey, this project demonstrates practical applications of machine learning for public safety.
